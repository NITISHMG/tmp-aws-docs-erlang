<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2><p>AWS Security Token Service</p>
 
  <p>AWS Security Token Service (STS) enables you to request temporary,  
limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).</p>
 
  This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more information
  about using this service, see Temporary Security Credentials.

<h3 class="function"><a name="assume_role-2">assume_role/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>assume_role(Client, Input) -&gt; any()</tt></p>
<p> </p>
</div><p><p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to  
access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to.</p>
 
  <p>These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access
  key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your
  account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with  
other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting  
Temporary Security Credentials and Comparing the AWS STS API operations in  
the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call <code>AssumeRole</code>. You
  must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.</p>
 
  <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need  
to access resources in each account. You could create long-term  
credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing  
all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account  
can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term  
credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to  
access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For  
more information about roles, see IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Session Duration</p>
 
  <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code>
  last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code>
  parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value
  from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting
  for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To
  learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View the Maximum
  Session Duration Setting for a Role in the IAM User Guide. The maximum
  session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API
  operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not  
apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more  
information, see Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Permissions</p>
 
  <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to
  make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot
  call the AWS STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p>
 
  <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this  
operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline  
session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as  
managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and  
managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies  
to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting  
session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based  
policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary  
credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account  
that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more  
permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role  
that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the  
IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be  
trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust  
policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts  
are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account.</p>
 
  <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
  permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The
  administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
  <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is  
in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a  
different account).</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust  
policy.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based  
policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit  
permission to assume the role. For more information about trust policies  
and resource-based policies, see IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Tags</p>
 
  <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags  
are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see  
Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session  
tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you  
to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial:  
Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during  
role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags  
in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Using MFA with AssumeRole</p>
 
  <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
  when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to  
ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an  
AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being  
assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the  
caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the  
role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA  
authentication might look like the following example.</p>
 
  <p><code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code></p>
 
  <p>For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access in the IAM  
User Guide guide.</p>
 
  To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and
  <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's
  hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time
  password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><p><p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have  
been authenticated via a SAML authentication response.</p>
 
  <p>This operation provides a mechanism for tying an enterprise identity store
  or directory to role-based AWS access without user-specific credentials or
  configuration. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> with the other API  
operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary  
Security Credentials and Comparing the AWS STS API operations in the IAM  
User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this operation consist of  
an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications  
can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS  
services.</p>
 
  <p>Session Duration</p>
 
  <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by
  <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional
  <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. Your
  role session lasts for the duration that you specify, or until the time
  specified in the SAML authentication response's <code>SessionNotOnOrAfter</code>
  value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> value
  from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting
  for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To
  learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View the Maximum
  Session Duration Setting for a Role in the IAM User Guide. The maximum
  session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API
  operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not  
apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more  
information, see Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Permissions</p>
 
  <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can be
  used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception:
  you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API  
operations.</p>
 
  <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this  
operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline  
session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as  
managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and  
managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies  
to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting  
session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based  
policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary  
credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account  
that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more  
permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role  
that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the  
IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> does not require the use of AWS security  
credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the  
metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your  
identity provider.</p>
 
  <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail
  logs. The entry includes the value in the <code>NameID</code> element of the SAML
  assertion. We recommend that you use a <code>NameIDType</code> that is not associated
  with any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you could
  instead use the persistent identifier
  (<code>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent</code>).</p>
 
  <p>Tags</p>
 
  <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your SAML  
assertion as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an  
associated value. For more information about session tags, see Passing  
Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys can’t  
exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For  
these and additional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits in the IAM  
User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags
  into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can
  fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other requirements.
  The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close  
the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.</p>
 
  <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to  
the role. When you do, session tags override the role's tags with the same  
key.</p>
 
  <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session  
tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you  
to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial:  
Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during  
role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags  
in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>SAML Configuration</p>
 
  <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code>, you must configure  
your SAML identity provider (IdP) to issue the claims required by AWS.  
Additionally, you must use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to  
create a SAML provider entity in your AWS account that represents your  
identity provider. You must also create an IAM role that specifies this  
SAML provider in its trust policy.</p>

been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity  
provider.</p>
 
  <p>Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook,  
Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.</p>
 
  <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can  
use Amazon Cognito with the AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide and the AWS  
SDK for Android Developer Guide to uniquely identify a user. You can also  
supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an  
application.</p>
 
  <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see Amazon Cognito Overview in AWS SDK  
for Android Developer Guide and Amazon Cognito Overview in the AWS SDK for  
iOS Developer Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of AWS
  security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for
  example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials
  without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also
  don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS
  credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a
  token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of
  <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce  
temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials and  
Comparing the AWS STS API operations in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an  
access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can  
use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API  
operations.</p>
 
  <p>Session Duration</p>
 
  <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by
  <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the
  optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your
  session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the
  maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a
  value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for
  your role, see View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role in the
  IAM User Guide. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use
  the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands.  
However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a  
console URL. For more information, see Using IAM Roles in the IAM User  
Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Permissions</p>
 
  <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>
  can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following
  exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or
  <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p>
 
  <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this

session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as  
managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and

that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more  
permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role  
that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the  
IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Tags</p>
 
  <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web  
identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name  
and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see  
Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys can’t

in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Identities</p>
 
  <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must  
have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a  
role that the application can assume. The role that your application  
assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the  
identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in  
the role's trust policy.</p>
 
  <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your AWS  
CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the Subject of the provided Web  
Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally  
identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could  
instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as suggested in the OIDC  
specification.</p>

</div><p><p>Decodes additional information about the authorization status of a  
request from an encoded message returned in response to an AWS request.</p>
 
  <p>For example, if a user is not authorized to perform an operation that he
  or she has requested, the request returns a <code>Client.UnauthorizedOperation</code>  
response (an HTTP 403 response). Some AWS operations additionally return  
an encoded message that can provide details about this authorization  
failure.</p>
 
  <p>Only certain AWS operations return an encoded authorization message. The  
documentation for an individual operation indicates whether that operation  
returns an encoded message in addition to returning an HTTP code.</p>
 
  <p>The message is encoded because the details of the authorization status can
  constitute privileged information that the user who requested the
  operation should not see. To decode an authorization status message, a
  user must be granted permissions via an IAM policy to request the
  <code>DecodeAuthorizationMessage</code> (<code>sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage</code>) action.</p>
 
  <p>The decoded message includes the following type of information:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> Whether the request was denied due to an explicit deny or due to  
the absence of an explicit allow. For more information, see Determining  
Whether a Request is Allowed or Denied in the IAM User Guide.</p>

  <p>Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example,

  <code>wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY</code>). For more information about  
access keys, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>When you pass an access key ID to this operation, it returns the ID of the
  AWS account to which the keys belong. Access key IDs beginning with <code>AKIA</code>
  are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user.
  Access key IDs beginning with <code>ASIA</code> are temporary credentials that are
  created using STS operations. If the account in the response belongs to
  you, you can sign in as the root user and review your root user access
  keys. Then, you can pull a credentials report to learn which IAM user owns
  the keys. To learn who requested the temporary credentials for an <code>ASIA</code>  
access key, view the STS events in your CloudTrail logs in the IAM User  
Guide.</p>
 
  This operation does not indicate the state of the access key. The key
  might be active, inactive, or deleted. Active keys might not have

</div><p><p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an  
access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated  
user.</p>
 
  <p>A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security
  credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate
  network. You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the
  long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is
  appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored,
  usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of
  <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary  
credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials and Comparing  
the AWS STS API operations in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
  users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook,
  Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case,
  we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>.  
For more information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider  
in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of  
an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we  
recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy  
application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated  
users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more  
information, see IAM Best Practices in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Session duration</p>
 
  <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900  
seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The  
default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary  
credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials  
have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p>
 
  <p>Permissions</p>
 
  <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in  
any AWS service except the following:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS  
API.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> You must pass an inline or managed session policy to this  
operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline  
session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as  
managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and  
managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p>
 
  <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a
  policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When
  you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of
  the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives
  you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You
  cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are
  defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information,
  see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. For information about using
  <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security credentials, see  
GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker.</p>
 
  <p>You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based
  policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session
  in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions  
allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the  
permissions granted by the session policies.</p>
 
  <p>Tags</p>
 
  <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are  
called session tags. For more information about session tags, see Passing  
Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session  
tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you  
to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial:  
Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
  means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag
  keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the
  <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code>
  session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags,
  and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user
  tag.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><p><p>Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM  
user.</p>
 
  <p>The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a
  security token. Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want to use
  MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS API operations like
  Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code>. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call
  <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA
  device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned from
  the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API operations
  that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code,
  then the API returns an access denied error. For a comparison of
  <code>GetSessionToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary  
credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials and Comparing  
the AWS STS API operations in the IAM User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Session Duration</p>
 
  <p>The <code>GetSessionToken</code> operation must be called by using the long-term AWS  
security credentials of the AWS account root user or an IAM user.  
Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration that  
you specify. This duration can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a  
maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43,200 seconds  
(12 hours). Credentials based on account credentials can range from 900  
seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1  
hour.</p>
 
  <p>Permissions</p>
 
  <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>GetSessionToken</code> can be  
used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication  
information is included in the request.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> You cannot call any STS API except <code>AssumeRole</code> or
  <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> We recommend that you do not call <code>GetSessionToken</code> with AWS  
account root user credentials. Instead, follow our best practices by  
creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and  
using IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS.</p>
 
  <p>The credentials that are returned by <code>GetSessionToken</code> are based on
  permissions associated with the user whose credentials were used to call
  the operation. If <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using AWS account root user
  credentials, the temporary credentials have root user permissions.
  Similarly, if <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using the credentials of an IAM  
user, the temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user.</p>
 
  For more information about using <code>GetSessionToken</code> to create temporary
  credentials, go to Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted
  Environments in the IAM User Guide.</p>
