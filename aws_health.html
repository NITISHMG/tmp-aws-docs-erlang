<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2><p>AWS Health</p>
 
  <p>The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health  
information that appears in the AWS Personal Health Dashboard.</p>
 
  <p>You can use the API operations to get information about AWS Health events  
that affect your AWS services and resources.</p>
 
  <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan from AWS Support to
  use the AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account
  that doesn't have a Business or Enterprise support plan, you receive a
  <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.</p>
 
  <p>AWS Health has a single endpoint: health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS).  
Use this endpoint to call the AWS Health API operations.</p>
 
  <p>For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4  
Signing Process.</p>
 
  <p>If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS  
Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized  
view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You  
can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in your  
organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified of  
security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to  
enable this feature and return event information. For more information,  
see Aggregating AWS Health events in the AWS Health User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>When you use the AWS Health API operations to return AWS Health events,  
see the following recommendations:</p>
 
  <p>Use the eventScopeCode parameter to specify whether to return AWS Health  
events that are public or account-specific.</p>
 
  Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you
  call the <code>DescribeEventsForOrganization</code> operation to get all events in
  your organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the
  <code>nextToken</code> in the next request to return more results.

  <p>When you call the <code>DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization</code> operation, you
  specify the <code>organizationEventDetailFilters</code> object in the request.  
Depending on the AWS Health event type, note the following differences:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> If the event is public, the <code>awsAccountId</code> parameter must be  
empty. If you specify an account ID for a public event, then an error  
message is returned. That's because the event might apply to all AWS  
accounts and isn't specific to an account in your organization.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> If the event is specific to an account, then you must specify
  the <code>awsAccountId</code> parameter in the request. If you don't specify an  
account ID, an error message returns because the event is specific to an  
AWS account in your organization.</p>

  <p>This operation doesn't remove the service-linked role (SLR) from the AWS

  You can also disable the organizational feature by using the Organizations
  DisableAWSServiceAccess API operation. After you call this operation, AWS
  Health stops aggregating events for all other AWS accounts in your

  view, AWS Health returns an error. AWS Health continues to aggregate
  health events for your AWS account.</p>
