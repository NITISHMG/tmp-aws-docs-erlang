<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2><p>Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold data."</p>
 
  <p>Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure,  
durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival.</p>
 
  <p>With Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months,  
years, or decades. Glacier also enables customers to offload the  
administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they  
don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data  
replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware  
migrations.</p>
 
  <p>Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and  
your data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or  
frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more  
information, see Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).</p>
 
  <p>You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on  
the total amount of data you can store in Glacier.</p>
 
  <p>If you are a first-time user of Glacier, we recommend that you begin by  
reading the following sections in the Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> What is Amazon S3 Glacier - This section of the Developer Guide  
describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the  
AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Getting Started with Amazon S3 Glacier - The Getting Started  
section walks you through the process of creating a vault, uploading  
archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the job output,  
and deleting archives.</p>
 
  </li> </ul>

</div><p><p>This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID.</p>
 
  <p>After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any
  more parts to the multipart upload or complete the multipart upload.
  Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an already-aborted
  upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about
  uploading a part and completing a multipart upload, see
  <code>UploadMultipartPart</code> and <code>CompleteMultipartUpload</code>.</p>
 
  <p>This operation is idempotent.</p>
 
  <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).  
However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any  
permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform  
specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS

  not in the <code>Locked</code> state.</p>
 
  <p>If the vault lock is in the <code>Locked</code> state when this operation is
  requested, the operation returns an <code>AccessDeniedException</code> error.  
Aborting the vault locking process removes the vault lock policy from the  
specified vault.</p>
 
  <p>A vault lock is put into the <code>InProgress</code> state by calling
  <code>InitiateVaultLock</code>. A vault lock is put into the <code>Locked</code> state by
  calling <code>CompleteVaultLock</code>. You can get the state of a vault lock by
  calling <code>GetVaultLock</code>. For more information about the vault locking  
process, see Amazon Glacier Vault Lock. For more information about vault  
lock policies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies.</p>
 
  This operation is idempotent. You can successfully invoke this operation
  multiple times, if the vault lock is in the <code>InProgress</code> state or if there
  is no policy associated with the vault.</p>

  Each tag is composed of a key and a value. Each vault can have up to 10

<p> </p>
</div><p><p>You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that  
all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble  
the archive from the uploaded parts.</p>
 
  <p>After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the
  URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you
  can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save
  the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can
  also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault.
  For more information, see <code>InitiateJob</code>.</p>
 
  <p>In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the
  entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256
  tree hash, see Computing Checksums. On the server side, Glacier also
  constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values
  match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an
  error, and the operation fails. The <code>ListParts</code> operation returns a list  
of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum  
information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad  
checksum issue.</p>
 
  <p>Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when  
assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier  
returns an error and the operation fails.</p>
 
  <p>Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first  
successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again  
within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same  
archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue  
that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which  
case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the  
same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that  
after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts  
operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart  
Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><p><p>This operation initiates a multipart upload.</p>
 
  <p>Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID
  in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to
  upload parts of an archive (see <code>UploadMultipartPart</code>).</p>
 
  <p>When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number  
of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power  
of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608  
(8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the  
maximum is 4 GB.</p>
 
  <p>Every part you upload to this resource (see <code>UploadMultipartPart</code>), except  
the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size  
or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you  
initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload  
four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.</p>
 
  <p>You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart  
upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the  
overall archive size.</p>
 
  <p>After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier)  
removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also  
removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload  
or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.</p>

  </li> <li><p> Returning a lock ID, which is used to complete the vault

  </li> </ul><p> You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this  
policy can be up to 20 KB in size. For more information about vault lock  
policies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies.</p>
 
  <p>You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the
  vault lock enters the <code>InProgress</code> state. After the 24 hour window ends,
  the lock ID expires, the vault automatically exits the <code>InProgress</code> state,
  and the vault lock policy is removed from the vault. You call
  <code>CompleteVaultLock</code> to complete the vault locking process by setting the
  state of the vault lock to <code>Locked</code>.</p>
 
  <p>After a vault lock is in the <code>Locked</code> state, you cannot initiate a new

in-progress and jobs that have recently finished.</p>
 
  <p>The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job  
initiation time.</p>
 
  <p>Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before  
deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output  
of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period  
of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the  
event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to  
download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job  
to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the  
archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and  
download the archive while the job exists.</p>
 
  <p>The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the
  response <code>Marker</code> field. If there are no more jobs to list, the <code>Marker</code>
  field is set to <code>null</code>. If there are more jobs to list, the <code>Marker</code> field
  is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination
  of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set
  the marker request parameter to the <code>Marker</code> value for that job that you  
obtained from a previous List Jobs request.</p>
 
  <p>You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the
  response by specifying the <code>limit</code> parameter in the request. The default  
limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit,  
but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.</p>
 
  <p>Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the
  optional <code>statuscode</code> parameter or <code>completed</code> parameter, or both. Using
  the <code>statuscode</code> parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match
  either the <code>InProgress</code>, <code>Succeeded</code>, or <code>Failed</code> status. Using the
  <code>completed</code> parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were
  completed (<code>true</code>) or jobs that were not completed (<code>false</code>).</p>

  <p>Note the difference between this operation and listing parts

</div><p><p>This operation configures notifications that will be sent when  
specific events happen to a vault.</p>
 
  <p>By default, you don't get any notifications.</p>
 
  <p>To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the
  <code>notification-configuration</code> subresource of the vault. The request should  
include a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific  
events for which you want Amazon S3 Glacier to send notifications to the  
topic.</p>
 
  <p>Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to  
publish notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault to publish a  
notification for the following vault events:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> ArchiveRetrievalCompleted This event occurs when a job that was
  initiated for an archive retrieval is completed (<code>InitiateJob</code>). The
  status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The
  notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from
  <code>DescribeJob</code>.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> InventoryRetrievalCompleted This event occurs when a job that
  was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed (<code>InitiateJob</code>). The
  status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The
  notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from
  <code>DescribeJob</code>.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations  
(actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't  
have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission  
to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control  
Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).</p>

<p> </p>
</div><p><p>This operation adds an archive to a vault.</p>
 
  <p>This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is
  durably persisted. Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the
  <code>x-amz-archive-id</code> header of the response.</p>
 
  <p>You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3 Glacier.
  After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so
  that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the
  archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for
  better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field
  to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of
  archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get
  the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more
  information, see <code>InitiateJob</code>.</p>
 
  <p>You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For  
information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums.</p>
 
  <p>You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable
  ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either
  retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see
  <code>InitiateJob</code>. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any  
way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the  
description to retrieve or sort the archive list.</p>
 
  <p>Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the  
archive or its description.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><p><p>This operation uploads a part of an archive.</p>
 
  <p>You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in  
parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.</p>
 
  <p>Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following  
conditions is true:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> SHA256 tree hash does not matchTo ensure that part data is not  
corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and  
include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon S3  
Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't  
match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree  
hash, see Computing Checksums.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Part size does not matchThe size of each part except the last
  must match the size specified in the corresponding
  <code>InitiateMultipartUpload</code> request. The size of the last part must be the  
same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.</p>
 
  <p>If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you  
specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not  
the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the  
subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Range does not alignThe byte range value in the request does  
not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate  
request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB),  
then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB -  
1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6  
MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part  
multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites  
the previously uploaded data.</p>
 
  <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).  
However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
