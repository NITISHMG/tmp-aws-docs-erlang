<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2><p>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</p>
 
  <p>This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace  
Metering Service API.</p>
 
  <p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom  
usage dimensions.</p>
 
  <p>For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see AWS  
Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions in the AWS Marketplace  
Seller Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Submitting Metering Records</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> MeterUsage- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace  
product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running  
on EKS or ECS.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> BatchMeterUsage- Submits the metering record for a set of  
customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS)  
application.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> Accepting New Customers</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> ResolveCustomer- Called by a SaaS application during the  
registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the  
registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the  
browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a  
CustomerIdentifier and Product Code.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace  
must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the  
RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and  
BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call  
RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your  
seller reports. For more information on using the RegisterUsage operation,  
see Container-Based Products.</p>
 
  </li> </ul> BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You
  can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent
  are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of
  BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time.
  For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide .

</div><p><p>BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS  
Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.</p>
 
  <p>For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried  
with the same records or a subset of the input records.</p>
 
  <p>Every request to BatchMeterUsage is for one product. If you need to meter  
usage for multiple products, you must make multiple calls to  
BatchMeterUsage.</p>
 
  <p>BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.</p>
 
  <p>A UsageRecord can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to  
provide customers with usagedata split into buckets by tags that you  
define (or allow the customer to define).</p>
 
  BatchMeterUsage requests must be less than 1MB in size.</p>

  <p>For identical requests, the API is idempotent. It simply returns the

  <p>MeterUsage is authenticated on the buyer's AWS account using credentials  
from the EC2 instance, ECS task, or EKS pod.</p>
 
  MeterUsage can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to provide
  customers with usage data split into buckets by tags that you define (or
  allow the customer to define).</p>

</div><p><p>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must  
integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the  
RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering.</p>
 
  <p>Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to  
call RegisterUsage, but you may choose to do so if you would like to  
receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the  
behavior of RegisterUsage. RegisterUsage performs two primary functions:  
metering and entitlement.</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> Entitlement: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the  
customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS  
Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your  
container image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to  
guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a  
CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will only be  
thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent calls from the  
same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not  
throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer unsubscribes  
while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Metering: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per  
hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A  
minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For  
example, if a customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and  
a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will  
launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be charged:  
(10 * hourly_rate). Metering for software use is automatically handled by  
the AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane -- your software is not  
required to perform any metering specific actions, other than call  
RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to commence. The AWS  
Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers  
for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customers  
subscription state, removing the need for your software to perform  
entitlement checks at runtime.</p>
