<p> </p>
</div><p><p>Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the  
organization whose credentials made the request.</p>
 
  <p>This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background.
  Because <code>CreateAccount</code> operates asynchronously, it can return a  
successful completion message even though account initialization might  
still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can  
successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do  
one of the following:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> Use the <code>Id</code> member of the <code>CreateAccountStatus</code> response
  element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the
  <code>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</code> operation.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code>  
event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see  
Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User  
Guide.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> The user who calls the API to create an account must have the
  <code>organizations:CreateAccount</code> permission. If you enabled all features in
  the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked
  role named <code>AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations</code>. For more information, see AWS  
Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User  
Guide.</p>
 
  <p>If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
  <code>organizations:TagResource</code> permission.</p>
 
  <p>AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named
  <code>OrganizationAccountAccessRole</code> by default) that grants users in the  
management account administrator permissions in the new member account.  
Principals in the management account can assume the role. AWS  
Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new  
account from the organization's management account.</p>
 
  <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's management  
account.</p>
 
  <p>For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an AWS Account  
in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations  
console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to  
operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the  
end user license agreement (EULA) is not automatically collected. If you  
must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only  
after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at To leave an  
organization as a member account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account  
limits for the organization, contact AWS Support.</p>
 
  <p>If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because  
your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again.  
If the error persists, contact AWS Support.</p>
 
  <p>Using <code>CreateAccount</code> to create multiple temporary accounts isn't  
recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost  
Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For  
information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see  
Closing an AWS Account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.</p>
 
  When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
  whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to Billing
  Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that
  have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account.
  If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing
  information. For information about how to disable this switch for an
  account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools.</p>

  <p>For more information on the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, see the AWS GovCloud  
User Guide.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> You already have an account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region  
that is paired with a management account of an organization in the  
commercial Region.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> You call this action from the management account of your  
organization in the commercial Region.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> You have the <code>organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount</code> permission.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> AWS Organizations automatically creates the required
  service-linked role named <code>AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations</code>. For more  
information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS  
Organizations User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>AWS automatically enables AWS CloudTrail for AWS GovCloud (US) accounts,  
but you should also do the following:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage.</p>
 
  <p>For more information, see Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled in the AWS  
GovCloud User Guide.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
  <code>organizations:TagResource</code> permission. The tags are attached to the
  commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the
  GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the
  <code>TagResource</code> operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud  
account exists.</p>
 
  <p>You call this action from the management account of your organization in  
the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS  
GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account  
of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that  
organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the  
AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see AWS Organizations in the  
AWS GovCloud User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>Calling <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> is an asynchronous request that AWS
  performs in the background. Because <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> operates  
asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though  
account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait  
a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the  
status of the request, do one of the following:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> Use the <code>OperationId</code> response element from this operation to
  provide as a parameter to the <code>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</code> operation.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code>  
event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see  
Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User  
Guide.</p>
 
  </li> </ul>
 
  <p>When you call the <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> action, you create two accounts:  
a standalone account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region and an associated  
account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The  
account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the  
organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are  
associated with the same email address.</p>
 
  <p>A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows  
the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to  
assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated  
with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created  
in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the AWS  
GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of  
the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram  
that explains how account access works, see AWS Organizations in the AWS  
GovCloud User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an AWS Account  
in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations  
console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to  
operate as a standalone account is not automatically collected. This  
includes a payment method and signing the end user license agreement  
(EULA). If you must remove an account from your organization later, you  
can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps  
at To leave an organization as a member account in the AWS Organizations  
User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account  
limits for the organization, contact AWS Support.</p>
 
  <p>If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because  
your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again.  
If the error persists, contact AWS Support.</p>
 
  <p>Using <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> to create multiple temporary accounts isn't  
recommended. You can only close an account from the AWS Billing and Cost  
Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For  
information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see  
Closing an AWS Account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.</p>
 
  When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
  whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to Billing
  Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that
  have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account.
  If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing
  information. For information about how to disable this switch for an
  account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools.</p>

</div><p><p>Removes a member account from its parent organization.</p>
 
  <p>This version of the operation is performed by the account that wants to
  leave. To remove a member account as a user in the management account, use
  <code>RemoveAccountFromOrganization</code> instead.</p>
 
  <p>This operation can be called only from a member account in the  
organization.</p>
 
  <p>The management account in an organization with all features enabled can
  set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what administrators
  of member accounts can do. This includes preventing them from successfully
  calling <code>LeaveOrganization</code> and leaving the organization.</p>
 
  <p>You can leave an organization as a member account only if the account is  
configured with the information required to operate as a standalone  
account. When you create an account in an organization using the AWS  
Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of  
standalone accounts is not automatically collected. For each account that  
you want to make standalone, you must perform the following steps. If any  
of the steps are already completed for this account, that step doesn't  
appear.</p>
 
  <p>Choose a support plan</p>
 
  <p>Provide and verify the required contact information</p>
 
  <p>Provide a current payment method</p>
 
  <p>AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS  
activity that occurs while the account isn't attached to an organization.  
Follow the steps at To leave an organization when all required account  
information has not yet been provided in the AWS Organizations User Guide.</p>
 
  <p>You can leave an organization only after you enable IAM user access to  
billing in your account. For more information, see Activating Access to  
the Billing and Cost Management Console in the AWS Billing and Cost  
Management User Guide.</p>
 
  After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were attached to
  the account object in the organization are deleted. AWS accounts outside
  of an organization do not support tags.</p>
