  <p>Both the StreamName and the StreamARN parameters are optional, but you  
must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN when invoking this API  
operation.</p>
 
  <p>As a prerequsite to using GetCLip API, you must obtain an endpoint using
  <code>GetDataEndpoint</code>, specifying GET_CLIP for<code>the `APIName</code> parameter. '</p>
 
  <pre>  An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
  providing data through MP4:
 
  The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally, AAC
  or G.711 encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1 should be
  `V_MPEG/ISO/AVC' (for h.264) or V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for H.265). Optionally,
  the codec ID of track 2 should be `A_AAC' (for AAC) or A_MS/ACM (for
  G.711).
 
  Data retention must be greater than 0.
 
  The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in the
  Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for H.265 format.
  For more information, see MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC 14496-15. For
  information about adapting stream data to a given format, see NAL
  Adaptation Flags.
 
  The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec private
  data in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7) or the MS Wave
  format.
 
  You can monitor the amount of outgoing data by monitoring the
  `GetClip.OutgoingBytes' Amazon CloudWatch metric. For information about
  using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video Streams, see Monitoring Kinesis
  Video Streams. For pricing information, see Amazon Kinesis Video Streams
  Pricing and AWS Pricing. Charges for outgoing AWS data apply.</pre></p>

  <p>An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for  
providing data through MPEG-DASH:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and,
  optionally, AAC or G.711 encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of
  track 1 should be <code>V_MPEG/ISO/AVC</code> (for h.264) or V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for
  H.265). Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be <code>A_AAC</code> (for AAC) or  
A_MS/ACM (for G.711).</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Data retention must be greater than 0.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> The video track of each fragment must contain codec private  
data in the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for  
H.265 format. For more information, see MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC  
14496-15. For information about adapting stream data to a given format,  
see NAL Adaptation Flags.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain  
codec private data in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7)  
or the MS Wave format.</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> The following procedure shows how to use MPEG-DASH with  
Kinesis Video Streams:</p>
 
  <ol> <li><p> Get an endpoint using GetDataEndpoint, specifying
  <code>GET_DASH_STREAMING_SESSION_URL</code> for the <code>APIName</code> parameter.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Retrieve the MPEG-DASH URL using <code>GetDASHStreamingSessionURL</code>.
  Kinesis Video Streams creates an MPEG-DASH streaming session to be used
  for accessing content in a stream using the MPEG-DASH protocol.
  <code>GetDASHStreamingSessionURL</code> returns an authenticated URL (that includes  
an encrypted session token) for the session's MPEG-DASH manifest (the root  
resource needed for streaming with MPEG-DASH).</p>
 
  <p>Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could access  
it. The token provides access to the content of the stream. Safeguard the  
token with the same measures that you would use with your AWS credentials.</p>
 
  <p>The media that is made available through the manifest consists only of the  
requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data (such as  
frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates) is made  
available.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for  
the MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that supports the MPEG-DASH  
protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the initialization fragment and  
media fragments available through the manifest URL. The initialization  
fragment contains the codec private data for the stream, and other data  
needed to set up the video or audio decoder and renderer. The media  
fragments contain encoded video frames or encoded audio samples.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests  
stream metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests  
data, it calls the following actions:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> GetDASHManifest: Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest, which contains  
the metadata for the media that you want to playback.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment.
  The media player typically loads the initialization fragment before
  loading any media fragments. This fragment contains the "<code>fytp</code>" and
  "<code>moov</code>" MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to initialize the  
media player decoder.</p>
 
  <p>The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis  
video stream. It contains only the codec private data for the stream and  
respective track, which the media player needs to decode the media frames.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> GetMP4MediaFragment: Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
  fragments contain the "<code>moof</code>" and "<code>mdat</code>" MP4 atoms and their child  
atoms, containing the encoded fragment's media frames and their  
timestamps.</p>
 
  <p>After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming session,  
any fragments that don't contain the same codec private data cause an  
error to be returned when those different media fragments are loaded.  
Therefore, the codec private data should not change between fragments in a  
session. This also means that the session fails if the fragments in a  
stream change from having only video to having both audio and video.</p>
 
  <p>Data retrieved with this action is billable. See Pricing for details.</p>
 
  </li> </ul> </li> </ol><p> The following restrictions apply to MPEG-DASH  
sessions:</p>
 
  <p>A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The service  
might throttle a session if multiple media players are sharing it. For  
connection limits, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits.</p>
 
  <p>A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of ten active MPEG-DASH
  streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum number of
  sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created) session is
  closed. The number of active <code>GetMedia</code> connections on a Kinesis video
  stream does not count against this limit, and the number of active
  MPEG-DASH sessions does not count against the active <code>GetMedia</code> connection  
limit.</p>
 
  <p>The maximum limits for active HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming sessions are  
independent of each other.</p>
 
  <p>You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
  monitoring the <code>GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes</code> Amazon CloudWatch  
metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video  
Streams, see Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams. For pricing information,  
see Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Pricing and AWS Pricing. Charges for both  
HLS sessions and outgoing AWS data apply.</p>
 
  <p>For more information about HLS, see HTTP Live Streaming on the Apple  
Developer site.</p>
 
  <p>If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived  
media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it  
includes the following pieces of information:</p>
 
  <p><code>x-amz-ErrorType</code> HTTP header – contains a more specific error type in  
addition to what the HTTP status code provides.</p>
 
  <p><code>x-amz-RequestId</code> HTTP header – if you want to report an issue to AWS, the  
support team can better diagnose the problem if given the Request Id.</p>
 
  <p>Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to make  
programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and under what  
conditions, as well as provide information on what actions the client  
programmer might need to take in order to successfully try again.</p>

  </li> <li><p> The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain  
codec private data in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7).</p>
 
  </li> </ul><p> Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the  
fragmented MPEG-4 form (also called fMP4 or CMAF) or the MPEG-2 form (also  
called TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For more  
information about HLS fragment types, see the HLS specification.</p>
 
  <p>The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:</p>
 
  <ol> <li><p> Get an endpoint using GetDataEndpoint, specifying
  <code>GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL</code> for the <code>APIName</code> parameter.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Retrieve the HLS URL using <code>GetHLSStreamingSessionURL</code>. Kinesis
  Video Streams creates an HLS streaming session to be used for accessing
  content in a stream using the HLS protocol. <code>GetHLSStreamingSessionURL</code>  
returns an authenticated URL (that includes an encrypted session token)  
for the session's HLS master playlist (the root resource needed for  
streaming with HLS).</p>
 
  <p>Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could access  
it. The token provides access to the content of the stream. Safeguard the  
token with the same measures that you would use with your AWS credentials.</p>
 
  <p>The media that is made available through the playlist consists only of the  
requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data (such as  
frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates) is made  
available.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for  
the HLS master playlist to a media player that supports the HLS protocol.  
Kinesis Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization  
fragment, and media fragments available through the master playlist URL.  
The initialization fragment contains the codec private data for the  
stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio decoder and  
renderer. The media fragments contain H.264-encoded video frames or  
AAC-encoded audio samples.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests  
stream metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests  
data, it calls the following actions:</p>
 
  <ul> <li><p> GetHLSMasterPlaylist: Retrieves an HLS master playlist, which
  contains a URL for the <code>GetHLSMediaPlaylist</code> action for each track, and  
additional metadata for the media player, including estimated bitrate and  
resolution.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> GetHLSMediaPlaylist: Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which
  contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with the
  <code>GetMP4InitFragment</code> action, and URLs to access the MP4 media fragments
  with the <code>GetMP4MediaFragment</code> actions. The HLS media playlist also
  contains metadata about the stream that the player needs to play it, such
  as whether the <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>LIVE</code> or <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media
  playlist is typically static for sessions with a <code>PlaybackType</code> of
  <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media playlist is continually updated with new
  fragments for sessions with a <code>PlaybackType</code> of <code>LIVE</code>. There is a  
distinct HLS media playlist for the video track and the audio track (if  
applicable) that contains MP4 media URLs for the specific track.</p>
 
  </li> <li><p> GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment.
  The media player typically loads the initialization fragment before
  loading any media fragments. This fragment contains the "<code>fytp</code>" and
  "<code>moov</code>" MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to initialize the  
media player decoder.</p>

  </li> <li><p> GetTSFragment: Retrieves MPEG TS fragments containing both  
initialization and media data for all tracks in the stream.</p>
 
  <p>If the <code>ContainerFormat</code> is <code>MPEG_TS</code>, this API is used instead of
  <code>GetMP4InitFragment</code> and <code>GetMP4MediaFragment</code> to retrieve stream media.</p>
 
  <p>Data retrieved with this action is billable. For more information, see
